    -   #### Typography
        - The "Source Sans Pro" font was used as the main body font due to its no nonsense feel and popularity on countless other sites as as always should these font be inaccessable san-serif was chosen to be the backup font.

    -   #### Imagery
        -  The main carousel imagery was chosen to covey a particular message to range of different cycling enthusiasts, from the 'lone wolf' to the serious group rider and lastly to the casual cyclist. The rest of the product images were chosen from 1 or 2 cycling sites, from previous projects I had found mixing images from a lot of different sources produced an inconsistent look and feel to the site.

    -   #### BROWSING AND NAVIGATION
        &nbsp;

        | Number  | Visitor Type   | Visitor Requirements | Desired Outcome | Tested Outcome | Complete  |

        | 1 | As a First Time Visitor | I would like to easily understand the purpose of the site| So that I can decide if I am interested in the sites contents  | Upon landing on the main page users are greeted with a clean responsive site whose imagery and text convey a message that the sites primary goal revolves around cycling,and purchasing cycling related products, services and accesories | &#9745; |
        | 2 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to view different product categories | So that I easily identify a particular category I am interested in |  This user story is catered for in both the header and footer, the simple categorised main navigation menu along with  the footer section 'Browse by category' are allways obvious and present on every page reasuring the user that they will allways be able to jump between different categories | &#9745; |
        | 3 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to view individual products details | So that I can easily identify, price, product highlights, description, features, extra images and star ratings |   This user story has been tested so that when the user clicks/taps on a product be it in mobile or desktop, all product details are displayed in a user friendly format. These include the 'star rating' first followed by, extra images, highlights, description, features and price. | &#9745;|
        | 4 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to identify special offers and discounts | So that I can take advantage of offers on products I would like to purchase |  Tested outcome here Tested outcome here | &#9744; |
        | 5 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to see the total of my shopping basket easily | So that I can keep track of how much I am going to spend |  This user story is fulfilled on desktop which has the shopping bag and the subtotal in the top right hand corner of the screen. The user is able to browse the site adding and removing products to their bag, a quick glance lets them know what the cost is going to be. The user story is equally fulfilled on mobile and tablet views but this time the shopping bag and the subtotal is in the center of the screen. Futher more the session variable was tested by leaving items in the users shopping bag and navigating away from the site entirely. Once we browsed the site again the contents of our shopping bag stayed intact.| &#9745; |

        | 3 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to search for a product by name, description, or product highlight | So that I can find a particular item I would like to purchase | This user story was verified by selecting certain search terms that were common or unique to a particular product. Due to it being a 'OR' search request, should the search term not be found the results will display a message to the user and bring them back to safety with a call to action button. If the search term query is blank, it best to display 'all products' with an associated message to the user rather than a blank result | &#9745; |
        | 4 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to see what ive searched for and the number of results | So that I can see if the item i've searched for is availible on the site | This user story was tested by searching for deliberate known key words that both existed and also did not exist. In each case the search result will return a list of items with the 'Product Found' count listed at the top of the screen where it is very visible to the user, if the search result is not found there is an obvious message 'Sorry no results found' link to bring the user back to safety.  | &#9745; |

    -   #### CHECKOUT, PAYMENT AND ORDERS

        | 1 | As a First Time Visitor, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to see a summary of my order before payment | So that I can be sure of ordering the right amount of the correct item | This user story was tested on both desktop and mobile screen sizes. Once the user clicks on their shopping bag they are brought to the summary page, here the name, price, ean, picture and the item number are displayed for each product. As well as that there is a 'product counter' on the top right so the user can see at a glance how many unique products are in the bag without having to scroll down. | &#9745; |
        | 2 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to change the quantity or remove an item  before payment | So that we can change our mind last minute if we need to update the shopping bag| This user story was tested since on each item in the shopping bag summary page there is a quantity selector input box which displays the current quantity of that particular product in the shopping bag. From here the user can manually enter a number or use the '+' and '-' buttons to adjust as needed, once they are happy with the quantity the user just needs to click the 'Update Quantity' button to complete the action. Removing a product from the shopping bag is even simpler, just below the 'Update Quantity' button on each product field is a 'Remove Item' button, once the user presses this, that item is removed from the bag and the page refreshes to reflect the change. | &#9745; |
        | 3 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to view my past orders in my profile | So that I can check back over an old order in case we need to return an item. | Tested outcome here Tested outcome here | &#9744; |
        | 4 | As a First Time, Returning or Frequent Visitor | I would like to cancel the checkout process and not proceed to payment | So that I can easily exit out of the payment process should we change our mind | Tested outcome here Tested outcome here | &#9744; |

#### Products

    1. I've populated each category with 6 unique products all of which have 3 sepparate pictures. So Item1 refers to an individual product and each item has 3 pictures associated with it (Pic1,Pic2,Pic3)
    2. Please note: For items that seem to appear to have the same link for all 3 pictures to the same photo, that is because this is the same photo for all 3 pictures, its just edited to look like 3 distinct images. The reason is that suitible different angled images for this product were unavailible at the time
