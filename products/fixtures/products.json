      "highlights":"Meticulously developed for best-in-class aero road performance, this razor-sharp road racer was born to sprint, chase or make your attack. The frame is handcrafted using Advanced-grade composite material to produce a bike thatâ€™s lightweight and stiff with a responsive ride quality. The components are as integrated as they can possibly be, with smooth lines from the handlebar and stem, internal cable routing, and a WheelSystem that uses a 65mm deep rear rim for maximum aero performance and a shallower 42mm front for added control. Even the disc brakes are integrated into the frame, with flat-mount calipers and thru-axles designed to optimize the technology.",
